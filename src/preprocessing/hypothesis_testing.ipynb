    "### Analyzing Associations and Predicting Impact in Fire Incidents\n",
    "Our objective is to assess the strength of associations between fire incidents and predict their impact based on various circumstances. \n",
    "This impact will be measured using dependent variables, which may include features such as the number of people displaced, fatalities, property damage, among others. \n",
    "The circumstances surrounding fire incidents will be evaluated and treated as independent variables, encompassing features such as the extent of fire, ignition source, property use, etc.\n",

    "- Kruskal-Wallis Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test used to compare the medians of a continuous variable across different groups defined by a nominal variable. It is suitable when the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances (lack of outliers) required by ANOVA are not met.\n",
